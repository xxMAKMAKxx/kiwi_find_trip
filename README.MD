Find trip using source data
===========================

In data there are flights all around the world. This script: findtrips_by_city_argument.py will find exactly 10 flights from source (where 10th flight is back to source) maximally in one year and print them on stdout. Just try using: ./findtrips_by_city_argument.py PRG 1 for example (this should take around 1 minute).
